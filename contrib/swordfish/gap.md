## Gap Analysis

1. ```anyOf``` can't transfer into ```oneof``` field of protobuf.
2. ```object``` can't be directly marshalled into ```bytes``` filed.
3. The first letter of every json object must only be lower letter (no other characters).
4. It's hard to define ```string``` as a structure through protobuf.
